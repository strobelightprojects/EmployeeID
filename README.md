# Overview
I created this program to start working with the C# programming language. In this program, I created a basic Employee management system that collects the employee name and ID# and then saves it into a Txt file. This program allows the user to view all entered employee information and edit them. The program uses a while loop to act as a menu and then each option uses a function to execute. Overall, I achieved my goal of working with the C# programming language and getting practice building something that can be useful.

# Future Work

- Add in department or job title to the program
- Add in a wat to access the employee like email, phone number etc
- Add the ability to view a single employee by name or ID number 
- Improve by braking parts off into their own files for better coding mangement
